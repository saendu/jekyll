If you read IT blogs it is sometimes a bit like you going to your favourite gelateria place and read through the new hipster flavours they offer. Some may sound nice but you have no idea how they taste or what they even are (shout out to GDB). Today's flavour of the day is Dapr. I'll let the Gelato Master explain himself what this means:
> Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr): An event-driven, portable runtime for building microservices on cloud and edge. -- https://dapr.io

Yeah, any questions? In a cone or cup?

### What is Dapr?
Well, let's put it this way. Dapr is a clever way of building microservices without you having to decide in advance what technologies you are going to use. 

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:86%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/RLWwOuPbqObupogOLB" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Yeah sounds a bit odd. But in other words, it does not matter what technologies you use since all components are independent of each other and therefore easily exchangable. Of course we have a fancy word for that, it is called [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling).
Loose coupling is for sure not the new kid on the block, but with Dapr it will be much easier to build loosely coupled systems. Mainly because Dapr provides you with building blocks you can use for plugging your components together. In whatever way you want. At the time writing this article these building blocks are:

- Service-to-Service Invocation
- State Management
- Publish and Subscribe
- Resource Bindings
- Actors
- Observability
- Secrets

### Let's do an example
Imagine you have to develop and statful application. So first thing you will probabbly do is to clarify where and how you wanna perserve your state. Let us imagine the state (the data) is farely simple, so you could use a NoSQL database. So now the fun begins. What NoSQL database do you use? MongoDB, CosmosDB, RavenDB, DocumentDB, ... Just to name a few. Next you start to compare pros/cons of those databases and next time you wake up you are a NoSQL database sales professional. But actually you just wanted to perserve some simple state. A key-value pair. A json object. Why all this nonsens? 

### Do you remeber Dapr?
And then you remember Dapr. This jack of all trades device that can help you in all possible situations. So why not just use the State component of Dapr and start what you can do best. Developing web applications. 

So, you will `dapr init` and deploy a Dapr State component as follows:
```
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
spec:
  type: state.redis
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: YOUR_REDIS_HOST_HERE:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: YOUR_REDIS_KEY_HERE

```


So everytime you need to store a state you just send a `POST` with a payload to the Dapr endpoint `.../v1.0/state/statestore` that runs as a sidecar alongside your applications. And everytime you want to fetch your state you do a `GET` call to `../v1.0/state/statestore/<key>` and get back your data. 

Ok, if that was too fast let me explain what Dapr does under the hood.

### Dapr under the hood
I should maybe mention that Dapr runs best in a container environment like Docker. It can also run in a non-container environment [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/blob/master/README.md). For my convenience I will just explain how it works in a container environment, since this is probabbly 99% of the usecases you will use Dapr. 

When you use Docker you probabbly also use a container orchestrator like Kubernetes. So let's imagine we do that too.

So, the only special thing about Dapr is that you will define some metadata in your Kubernetes yaml files. Namely you will define some annoations in your deployment section. For example:
```
annotations:
  dapr.io/enabled: "true"
  dapr.io/id: "nodeapp"
  dapr.io/port: "3000"
```

This would tell Dapr the following:
1. The `dapr.io/enabled: "true"`will tell Dapr to inject a sidecar alongside your POD
2. The `dapr.io/id: "nodeapp"` will define a name `nodeapp` for your app that you can call it via Dapr
3. The `dapr.io/port: "3000"` will define the Dapr port `3000` for your application 

Imagine your nodeapp POD running normally as you would expect and next to it a Dapr POD runs that serves as a 'buttler' for component-to-component communication (now you also get the Dapr logo, do you?).

![Dapr-Logo](https://dapr.io/images/logos/dapr.svg)

So, instead of you calling your nodeapp directly `GET <nodeappUrl>/somemethod`, you would just call the Dapr url as follows: `GET <daprUrl>/v1.0/nodeapp/somemethod` and the buttler would do the heavy lifting - meaning knowing where the nodeapp is, how to call it etc. - for you. 

### Why would you do that
Why all this nonsense you ask. Well, let me give you the most obvious and simple example. Imagine your node app is used by hundrets of other applications not under your control. Now the worst case scenario happens and you need to completely refactor your nodeapp and rewrite it in python and not only that, you also have to move it to another hosting provider and therefore get a new URL.

Will you or me do the phonecall to all the clients to use the new URL? 

Somethig so simple like 'hardcoding' a URL already creates a dependency from one component to another. So replacing the dependant will not be that easy anymore. 

This is a common scenarion in a microservice architecture. As good as you might try, there will always be some microservices that depend on something else like a statestore. Or you perserve state inside of the microservices, but then you have to manage the data lifecycle, so good luck. And this is also why Dapr is described as a '[...] runtime for building **microservices** on cloud and edge.'
