This page should give you a brief overview about all my projects that I've started during the lockdown (COVID-19). If you also want to get your hands dirty, check if there is a article linked below. Furthermore you should also find links to Github and if available to the apps itself. Most of them are still in progress, so don't go to hard on me. ;-)

Currently there are six main projects running on my private cloud:
- [Raspberry Pie Cluster](#raspberry-pie-cluster)
- [Fuebiapp](#Fuebiapp)
- [Microservices built with OAM / Dapr](#microservices-with-oam-and-dapr) 
- [Private website (sandrofelder.ch)](#private-website)
- [Mail Gateway](#mail-gateway)

## Raspberry Pie Cluster
##### Tech: Raspberry Pie 4, Kubernetes, Ubuntu

Obviously enough I needed something to let all my projects run. So a Raspberry would have been a good choice. But since buying just 'one' RPI was too easy, I instead bought four and build my own Raspberry Pie 4 Cluster. And what would be a cluster without an orchestrator. That is why I decided to create a Kubernetes Cluster with my Raspberries.

## Fuebiapp
- **Tech**: Jitsi, React, Redux 
- **Websites**: [fuebiapp.com](https://fuebiapp.com), [afterworkbeer.com](https://afterworkbeer.com) 
- **Github**: [fuebiapp-web](https://github.com/saendu/fuebiapp-web), [fuebiapp-docker](https://github.com/saendu/fuebiapp-docker)

In my local dialect 'Fuebi' means 'afterwork beer'. Fuebiapp.com (or afterworkbeer.com) was one of my first Corona projects. Reason was I was missing the social times when we could have a beer together and get on each others nerves with poking others to take another round or just have a shots round.
So Fuebiapp is a conference/meeting platform where you can hang out and have a beer together. 

Some of the features include:
+ See all participans at once
+ Announce a shots round
+ Beer counter
+ Poke somebody to have another beer
