When Corona hit the fan and we all stuck in a lockdown, I've searched for some new hobbies. The result was a couple of IT projects that I've finally started. Below you get a brief overview about some of the noticeable projects. If you also want to get your hands dirty, check if there is an article linked below. Furthermore, you should also find links to Github if you are interested in the code and if available to the apps itself. Most of them are still in progress, so don't go to hard on me. ;-)

Currently there are four main projects running on my private cloud:
- [Raspberry Pie Cluster](#raspberry-pie-cluster)
- [Fuebiapp](#fuebiapp) 
- [Private website (sandrofelder.ch)](#private-website)
- [Mail Gateway](#mail-gateway)

## Raspberry Pie Cluster
![Cluster]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rpi4-cluster.jpg)
**Tech**: Raspberry Pie 4, Ubuntu, ARM64, Kubernetes, Docker, Nginx

Obviously, I needed something to host all of my projects. So, a Raspberry would have been a good choice. But since using just 'one' RPI was too easy, I instead bought four and build my own Raspberry Pie 4 Cluster. And what would be a cluster without an orchestrator. That is why I decided to create a Kubernetes Cluster with my Raspberries. 

If you wanna know more or maybe build your own, then read me article [Building your own Private Cloud with Raspberry Pi 4 and Kubernetes]({{ site.baseurl }}/your-own-private-cloud/)

## Fuebiapp
![Fuebiapp-Banner]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/fuebiapp-banner.jpg)
**Tech**: Jitsi, React, Redux 
**Github**: [fuebiapp-web](https://github.com/saendu/fuebiapp-web), [fuebiapp-docker](https://github.com/saendu/fuebiapp-docker)

In my local dialect 'Fuebi' means 'afterwork beer'. Fuebiapp.com (or afterworkbeer.com) was one of my first Corona projects. Reason was I was missing the social times when we could have a beer together and get on each otherâ€™s nerves with poking others to take another round or initiate a shot round.
So Fuebiapp is a conference/meeting platform where you can hang out and have a beer together. With some afterwork beer features.

Some of the features include:
+ See all participants at once
+ Announce a shot round
+ Beer counter
+ Poke somebody to have another beer

**Websites**: [fuebiapp.com](https://fuebiapp.com), [afterworkbeer.com](https://afterworkbeer.com) 

## Home Control API
![Cluster]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/home-automation.jpg)
**Tech**: NodeJS, Express
**Github**: [HomeControl](https://github.com/saendu/homecontrol)

I always wanted to control my room via Siri but Apple solution does not work in Switerland and most other products do not support Siri. The Home Control project allows me to control my IKEA smart plugs with Siri. It consists of a simple Express backend with an API that controls an IKEA gateway.

If you wanna know more, read my article [Hey Siri, I wanna sleep!]({{ site.baseurl }}/home-automation) that describes the project in detail.

## Private website 
![Website]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/website.jpg)

**Tech**: Jekyll
**Github**: [Jekyll](https://github.com/saendu/Jekyll)

The main idea why I created a private website, was to have a location to publish articles about my projects. Almost everybody I was bubbling to what I did during COVID was interested to build something on her own. So, I figured why not do something for the community and contribute back and share all my knowledge. Afterall I also came only that far because other people did the same before me. So here you go. 

If you find any typos, mistake or any other blunder let me know in the comments section or create an issue on Github. I will be very greatful! 

## Mail Gateway
**Tech**: Raspberry Pie 4, Kubernetes, Ubuntu

Comming soon.
